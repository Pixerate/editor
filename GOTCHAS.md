### [svelte/canvas] Svelte 5 Runes and .svelte Imports in Vitest

- **Issue / Symptom**: Running Vitest fails with `ReferenceError: $state is not defined` when executing tests against `.svelte.ts` files, or throws `TypeError: Unknown file extension ".svelte"` when importing `@xyflow/svelte`.
- **Root Cause**: Svelte 5 runes (`$state.raw`, `$derived`, etc.) and `.svelte` component distributions require compile-time transformation via `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` and a DOM environment (`jsdom`). In a monorepo, if the root Vitest config does not specify workspace project delegation, individual package configs are ignored.
- **Solution / Workaround**:
  1. Add `packages/svelte/vitest.config.ts` with `plugins: [svelte()]` from `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` and `test: { environment: 'jsdom' }`.
  2. Add root `vitest.config.ts` with `test: { projects: ['packages/*', 'apps/*'] }` so monorepo `pnpm test` delegates to package-level Vitest configurations.

### [svelte/canvas] Decoupling SvelteFlow via Optional Peer Dependencies and Subpath Exports

- **Issue / Symptom**: Adding canvas features to `@pixerate/editor-svelte` could unnecessarily bloat bundle sizes or require `@xyflow/svelte` for consumers who only need rich-text / TipTap editors.
- **Root Cause**: Putting `@xyflow/svelte` as a hard dependency in `dependencies` forces every consumer of `@pixerate/editor-svelte` to download SvelteFlow and its transitive dependencies.
- **Solution / Workaround**:
  1. Expose canvas features under the subpath export `./canvas` (`@pixerate/editor-svelte/canvas`) rather than the root entry.
  2. Define `@xyflow/svelte` under `peerDependencies` with `peerDependenciesMeta: { "@xyflow/svelte": { "optional": true } }`.
  3. Externalize `@xyflow/svelte` and `@dagrejs/dagre` in `packages/svelte/tsup.config.ts`.
